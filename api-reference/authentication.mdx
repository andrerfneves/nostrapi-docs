description: "Using API keys to authenticate your requests to NOSTRAPI."

To make use of the API endpoints in the NOSTRAPI suite, you will need to authenticate your requests. This is done by providing an API token in the `Authorization` header of your request.

```bash
'apikey': 'nostr_XXXXXXXXXX'
```

## API Keys

Every `account` in the NOSTRAPI system has a unique API key. This key is used to authenticate your requests to the API. You can find your specific accounts' API key in the [NOSTRAPI dashboard](https://nostrapi.com/login).

### Permissions

API keys have `full admin` rights to that specific account. This means that you can create, update and delete any data in the account. Please be careful with your API key and do not share it with anyone.
